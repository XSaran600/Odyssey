Snow Shader Notes

Heavily Influenced by:
- "TrailsParticleSystem" 	| found under player hiearchy 
Alters what particles are being rendered to the CameraTrailer


- "CameraTrailer" 		| in World Scene hiearchy
Controls the orthographic camera that reads the particle system influencing the displacement
Clipping planes influence what is being displace height wise


- "SnowShader"			| in SGs folder
Affects how the shader renders the geomerty and visuals


- "mAsh"			| in Ash Mat folder
Change trail and world texture
Affects the height height displacement via "Trail radius" and "Height Multiple"
Note if "HeightMultiple" is too high, player will float in the air
