Requirements & Setup
--------------------
1) This version of Beautify only works with High Definition Rendering Pipeline (HDRP 7.1.8 or later).
2) Make sure you have High Definition RP package imported in the project before importing Beautify to avoid compilation errors.
3) Make sure you have a High Definition RP asset assigned to Project Settings / Graphics. There's a HDRP sample asset in Demo folder.
4) Assign Beautify to the "After Post Process" list in Project Settings / HDRP Default Settings.
